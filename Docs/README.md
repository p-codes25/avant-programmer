This directory contains notes and documentation I put together while working on this project.

AvantHardwareNotes.txt - Info on hardware contained inside the Avant keyboards.

AvantKBDFileLayout.txt - Documents the *.kbd file format used by CVT's Avant software.

AvantKeyboardProtocolNotes.txt - Documents the byte protocol for reading and writing the programming data on Avant keyboards.

AvantSPILayout.txt - Documents the memory layout of the 2KB SPI flash/EEPROM chip onboard the Avant keyboard, used to store its programming data.

AvantSoftwareNotes.txt - Notes about the different versions of CVT's Avant programming software.

Stellar_Reset_to_factory.BIN - This is a plain binary file I read from my Avant Stellar keyboard's SPI flash chip (an FM24C16) after having factory-reset the keyboard. This can be used to re-flash an Avant Stellar (or possibly a Prime, although I haven't tried it) to put it back to factory programming.
