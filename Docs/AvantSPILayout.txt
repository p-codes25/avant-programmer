Notes on the layout of the 2K SPI flash RAM chip (FM24C16) onboard the CVT Avant keyboards:

+00	Signature? Has 0xAA55 on my keyboard.
+02	0x05 = ?
+03	0x20 = ?
+04	0x01 = ?
+05	0x00 or 0x01 = Comma/period lock flag, I think
+06	0x00 = ?
+07	0x00 = ?
+08	0x00 = ?
+09	0x00 = ?
+0A	0x00 = ?
+0B	0x00 usually, or 0x02 for Alt (Ctrl?) Locked?  Right special key flags, I think
+0C	0x00 = ?
+0D	0x00 usually, or 0x10 for Shift locked -- left special key flags, I think
+0E	0x00 = ?
+0F	0x00 = ?

+10	128 bytes of key slot mapping.  Each byte gives the key slot index to which
	that key slot is mapped.

+90	Seems to have key mapping modifiers, I'm guessing?  This is only 64 bytes,
	which implies 4 bits per key slot.  TBD: verify, document bit positions.

+D0	I'm guessing these are the key slot indexes for each of 48 macros.  There
	are 48 bytes here, which means the keyboard supports 48 macros?  However,
	there are only room for 24 macros * 69 bytes each in the 2K flash chip...

+100	WORD values, all 0x0081 in my version.  Something related to macros???

+130	Macro definitions - apparently each one is 0x46 bytes, which allows for 69 macro
	keystrokes plus the 0x81 terminator entry for each macro.  Each macro entry
	starts with an 0x81 if it is unused; otherwise it contains the list of key slot #
	for the keystrokes in the macro, followed by the 0x81 terminator byte.
	The macro definitions end at 0x7BF.

+7C0	Unused?
