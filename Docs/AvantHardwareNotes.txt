The controller on the Avant Stellar's PCB is an Atmel AT89c52.

It's an 8051-based microcontroller.

"Compatible with MCS-51 products."

8KB built-in flash.

1000 write/erase cycles.

256 byte internal RAM.

1E 52 FF are the device ID bytes that Xgecu reports... that means Vpp = 12V

Now for the bad news...

The flash memory on the 89c52 sppears to be locked :(  The chip does not provide
any way to read the status of the lock bits :(

And, trying to read the flash memory returns only FF bytes, which is supposed
to be the behavior for a locked chip :(

It also has an RIC FM24C16-P serial NVRAM chip...

16Kbits = 2KB size.

That seems to contains the keyboard remapping / macro / options configuration.

See AvantSPILayout.txt for notes on the NVRAM chip's contents.
